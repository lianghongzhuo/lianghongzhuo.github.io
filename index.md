# About me

Hello! I am Hongzhuo Liang. I completed my doctoral training in robot perception and manipulation at the Department of Informatics, the University of Hamburg (UHH), with Prof. Dr. Jianwei Zhang from 2016 to 2022. I am currently a postdoc research fellow of UHH, with research interests in robot grasping and dexterous manipulation.
